# SVG Logo Generator

## Description

In this unit we were meant to focus on Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and unit testing. The goal of this project was to create a Node.js command-line application and to have it generate an SVG logo based on user selection and save it as an SVG File. Th reason why I made this Logo Generator was because as a Full-Stack Developer, I need to learn as many skills as I can with Node.js. I learned how to implement Template Literal and how to generate a markdown, these are skills that will be very useful in the future.

## User Story

AS a freelance web developer

I WANT to generate a simple logo for my project

SO THAT I don't have to pay a graphic designer



## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input

WHEN I am prompted for text

THEN I can enter up to three characters

WHEN I am prompted for the text color

THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)

WHEN I am prompted for a shape

THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, 
triangle, and square

WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color

THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)

WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts

THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`

AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line

WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser

THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered


## Usage

In order to be able to use the SVG Logo Generator all you have to do is open the terminal using index.js and type node index into the terminal. This will populate a set of prompts for you to answer regarding the shape, color of the shape, text and text color that you want your logo to be made up of. Once these prompts are answered, a logo.svg will be created on your Explorer list. Right click the logo.svg and open it in a browser. There you'll be able to see what your logo looks like (look at example below).
